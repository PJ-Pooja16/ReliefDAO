## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #2E9CCA (a vibrant, but desaturated blue) symbolizes trust, stability, and aid. This hue will be used sparingly but in high-impact locations to highlight the most crucial information.
- Background color: #F2F8FA (very light, desaturated blue) offers a clean, calming backdrop, promoting a sense of security and stability.
- Accent color: #A75549 (desaturated orange-red). It will be used for CTAs to create good contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look.
- Heroicons for common UI elements; custom designed icons for specific disaster types and status indicators to improve visual comprehension.
- A clean, grid-based layout with clear sectioning to improve information hierarchy and readability.
- Subtle animations, such as progress bar updates and loading sequences, will provide feedback and improve the user experience without being distracting.
